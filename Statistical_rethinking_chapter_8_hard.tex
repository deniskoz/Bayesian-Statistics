The markov chain is taking samples from a posterior distribution with
1000 iterations for a and b. This is a resampling techinque that doesnt
assume any kind of distribution. In this case, we can tell if the chain
is strong and if the samples are strongly correlated with each other.

\section{Compare the samples for the parameters a and b. Can you explain
the different trace plots, using what you know about the Cauchy
distribution?}\label{compare-the-samples-for-the-parameters-a-and-b.-can-you-explain-the-different-trace-plots-using-what-you-know-about-the-cauchy-distribution}

The book mentions that the couchy distribution has no mean and standard
deviations. Because of this, an outlier can overwhelm prior samples.
This can be seen in the second plot with a large and unpredictable
variance in some samples. But, the central tendancy towards the center
point is seen more clearly in the couchy distribution. The Gaussian
distribtuion plot is overwhelmingly dense.

The results demonstrate that the model with the highest accuracy used
the median age of marriage to predict divorce. It is important to
remember that a smaller WAIC indicates better estimated out-of-sample
deviance.

\section{8H3. Sometimes changing a prior for one parameter has
unanticipated effects on other parameters. This is because when a
parameter is highly correlated with another parameter in the posterior,
the prior influences both parameters. Here's an example to work and
think through. Go back to the leg length example in Chapter 5. Here is
the code again, which simulates height and leg lengths for 100 imagined
individuals:}\label{h3.-sometimes-changing-a-prior-for-one-parameter-has-unanticipated-effects-on-other-parameters.-this-is-because-when-a-parameter-is-highly-correlated-with-another-parameter-in-the-posterior-the-prior-influences-both-parameters.-heres-an-example-to-work-and-think-through.-go-back-to-the-leg-length-example-in-chapter-5.-here-is-the-code-again-which-simulates-height-and-leg-lengths-for-100-imagined-individuals}

Note that T{[}0,{]} on the right-hand side of the prior for br. What the
T{[}0,{]} does is truncate the normal distribution so that it has
positive probability only above zero. In other words, that prior ensures
that the posterior distribution for br will have no probability mass
below zero. Compare the two posterior distributions for m5.8s and
m5.8s2. What has changed in the posterior distribution of both beta
parameters? Can you explain the change induced by the change in prior?

The slopes(beta parameters) was halved (from 2.07-1.09 \& 2.08=1.08) and
when truncating half of the distribution. Because the left and right leg
are dependent on each other, both of the slopes changed when truncating
only one of the slopes.

m.8s has more effective parameters (pWAIC = 3.5). The reason is because
it is capturing more samples. Specifically, the samples that have a
negative br slope. This can be bad or good because m.8s could be
capturing a lot of noise in the samples that is not applicable to the
question at hand.
